A plugin for Growl 1.2.2 - More information [here](https://github.com/aglv/growl-mailmetoo/wiki), download [here](https://github.com/aglv/growl-mailmetoo/releases).

This Growl plugin was developed in 2011, back when Growl's email capabilities were rather basic. _MailMeToo_ was built to replace the _MailMe_ notification style for those who weren't happy with it. Instead of routing notifications through _Mail.app_, _MailMeToo_ connects to a specified SMTP server and directly sends the notification as an email message. The original release name was _SMTP Mail_.

With _Growl 2.0_, _MailMeToo_ was pulled into _Growl_ to replace the original _MailMe_ plugin. For that reason, you don't need to install this plugin anymore, unless for some reason you're using an older version of Growl (specifically, version 1.2.2).

This project contains an Obj-C implementation of the SMTP protocol.
